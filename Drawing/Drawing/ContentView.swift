//Notes
//SwiftUI Provides underlying object Path() to draw shapes
//It is low levelObject, Paths are Views just like Shape , Colors etc
//Paths needs tobe wrapped inside a view as it is positioned based on coordinate poins which varies from device to device or inside GeometryReader to place the path in view accordingly
